    /**
     * Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi]
     * represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k,
     * return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
     *
     * The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is
     * the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
     *
     * You may return the answer in any order.
     * The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
     * Output: [[-2,2]]
     * Explanation:
     * The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
     * The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
     * Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
     * We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
     *
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
     * Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
     * Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.
     *
     * Constraints:
     *     1 <= k <= points.length <= 104
     *     -104 < xi, yi < 104
     *
     * @param points
     * @param k
     * @return
