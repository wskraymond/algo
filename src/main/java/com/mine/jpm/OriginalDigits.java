     * Given a string s containing an out-of-order English

     *
     * return the digits in ascending order.

     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: s = "owoztneoer"
     * Output: "012"

     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: s = "fviefuro"
     * Output: "45"

     * could be present as well in the another numbers
     * that means that the straightforward approach could be misleading.
