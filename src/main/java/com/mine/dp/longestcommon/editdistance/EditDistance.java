     * Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.
     *
     * You have the following three operations permitted on a word:
     *
     * Insert a character
     * Delete a character
     * Replace a character
     *
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
     * Output: 3
     * Explanation:
     * horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
     * rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
     * rose -> ros (remove 'e')
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
     * Output: 5
     * Explanation:
     * intention -> inention (remove 't')
     * inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
     * enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
     * exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
     * exection -> execution (insert 'u')
     *
     * @param word1
     * @param word2
     * @return
